  <h3 class = "text-center">About Polio</h3>
    <p class = "text-center">Poliomyelits, commonly known as Polio is a highly infection viral disease mostly affected young children. The virus is transmitted by person-to-person spread mainly through the faecal-oral route or, less frequently, by a common vehicle (e.g. contaminated water or food) and multiplies in the intestine, from where it can invade the nervous system and can cause paralysis.

Initial symptoms of polio include fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, stiffness in the neck, and pain in the limbs. In a small proportion of cases, the disease causes paralysis, which is often permanent. There is no cure for polio, it can only be prevented by immunization. This information is from the <a rel="nofollow" rel="noreferrer"href="http://www.who.int/topics/poliomyelitis/en/">World Health Organization</a>, which is a great source of information about the disease.</p>

    <h3 class = "text-center">More on Jonas Salk</h3>
    <p class = "text-center">Jonas Salk was a virologist that discovered and developed the polio vaccine. What was great about his life is that did not patent the vaccine because he considered it immoral to market a cure that could prevent pain to many families and people around the country and the world. Until 1955, polio was considered one of the most frightening health problems in the world. Salk help resolve this issue by developing the vaccine. Salk campaigned for mandatory vaccination, claiming that public health should be considered a "moral commitment."
